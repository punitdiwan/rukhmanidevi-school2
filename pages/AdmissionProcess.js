                                <p>After registration the students are required to visit the Campus, on a date scheduled by the Schoolâ€™s Admission Office, for an Orientation Programme.</p>

                                <p>The list of successful candidates is declared within a week after the Orientation and the admission needs to be accepted/ declined within a week from this declaration.</p>
                                <p>Admissions are granted with due preference to brothers/sisters of present Grovians, brothers/sisters/children of Old Grovians, children of serving defence personnel, war widows, Govt Employees and brilliant scholarship/free-ship students from the poorer section of society.

                                <h4>Age Criteria:</h4>
                                <p>Generally, admission will be offered in Class I (1st Grade) for a child aged between 5 to 6-1/2 (five to six and a half years) as on 28th February of the year of admission. The subsequent classes can be so calculated. Generally, the accepted formula is, age of child minus 5 or 6 = Class to be admitted.</p>
                                <p>The standard rule being that the admission will be granted provisionally for the first year and further continuance will depend on the child's performance, academic and otherwise, during the first year of his/her stay in the school.</p>
                               
                                <span> <b> <i>Important note:</i></b></span>
                                <p><b><i>The boarding school orientation so conducted is not a test or criteria for promotion nor a process of selection/rejection but only meant to gauge the mental and physical make-up of a student to adjust to hostel life, which is vastly different to normal day-schools.</i></b></p>
                                <p>Hence all new admissions have to join the school after successful completion of their academic session in the previous school and obtaining proper School Leaving Certificates.</p>

                                <p>1.  Rights of admission to the Senior Secondary Stage (Plus 1 & 2) are reserved. Children passing out of the secondary stage from Pinegrove will not have rights for direct admission to the Senior Secondary Stage and will need to reapply for admission for the senior secondary stage. No re-admission fee will be charged if the request for admission reaches the school Office by the appointed date announced by the school authorities.</p>
                                <p> 2.  Due to very limited seats, preference for admission will be given to students passing out from the 10th class from Rukhmani Devi School itself.</p>
                                <p>3.  Children shall be considered for admissions and be offered provisional admission, on the basis of the result card of the 9th Class Final Exams and the Pre-Board Result of 10th Class. The cut off percentage for admission will be announced each year as per school rules. Appropriate weightage shall be given to students excelling in sports and at the discretion of the school management.</p>
                                <p>4. Admission to Class XI, may not be offered, dependent on limited availability of seats or on conduct and academic performance of the child during the previous stay of the child in the school.</p>
                                <p>5. In the best interest of the child no reasons for rejection need be given and the decision of the School Management and/or the Head of School will be final and binding.</p>
                                <p>6. All admissions will be provisional till such time the Secondary School Board results are not declared. The provisional admission shall be confirmed after the senior secondary board result.</p>
                                <p>7. The provisional admission will be withdrawn in such cases where the minimum percentage is not obtained or if a child gets a Compartment or a Fail result in the Secondary School Board results.</p>
                                <p>8. New Admissions for Class XI shall follow the procedure of Registration, Admission test and interview.</p>
