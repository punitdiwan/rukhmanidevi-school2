                            <p>37. Ordinarily, no withdrawal should be made during the academic session, as a child needs time to settle to the new environment of hostel life, hence parents should make up their minds very firmly before accepting the admission.</p>

Notice of withdrawal must be sent by Registered AD post and should reach the School Office latest by the 31st of December intimating that the child will not be returning to the school in the next academic year. If such a notice is not received, on time, then the security deposit of the child will stand forfeited.</p>
                            <p>41. Transfer certificates shall only be issued after all school dues have been cleared and an NOC from all relevant departments has been obtained. A minimum of ten working days is required for the issue of a TC.</p>
                            <p>42. In the cases where the security deposit is to be refunded all claims must be made within one year of the date of withdrawal along with the original receipt failing which no such claim will be entertained thereafter.</p>
                            <p>43. There will be no refund of fees in the cases where the child has been expelled or his withdrawal has been requested for, on disciplinary grounds.</p>
                            <p>44. School scholarships/ bursaries or fee concessions, if allowed, are at the sole discretion of the management and can be withdrawn at any time and no reason maybe given for the same. </p>
