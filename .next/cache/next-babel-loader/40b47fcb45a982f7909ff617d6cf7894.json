The computers are networked on LAN and there is a huge repository of educational software, in various subjects and practically for every chapter in the course of study, available on the school servers. The classrooms are fitted with the latest and best equipment available so that the children get the best teaching aids to assist in making the teaching learning process most effective, through computer-aided-teaching (CAT). The children and teachers alike take keen interest in the beautification and adornment of their classrooms. To achieve the highest levels of academic excellence the school maintains a class-section average strength of just 25 pupils in junior classes and 30 pupils in senior classes.\"\n                }), /*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"div\", {\n                  className: \"row\",\n                  children: slides.map((item, i) => {\n                    return /*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"div\", {\n                      className: \"col-sm-6 then-img\",\n                      children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"img\", {\n                        src: item.title,\n                        alt: \"Avatar\",\n                        style: {\n                          width: \"100%\",\n                          height: \"350px\"\n                        }\n                      })\n                    });\n                  })\n                })]\n              })]\n            })]\n          })]\n        })]\n      })\n    })\n  });\n};\n\nexport default GamesSports;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
