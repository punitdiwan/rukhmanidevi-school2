Children shall be considered for admissions and be offered provisional admission, on the basis of the result card of the 9th Class Final Exams and the Pre-Board Result of 10th Class.

Appropriate weightage shall be given to students excelling in sports and at the discretion of the school management.</p>\n                                <p>4.

In the best interest of the child no reasons for rejection need be given and the decision of the School Management and/or the Head of School will be final and binding.</p>\n                                <p>6.
